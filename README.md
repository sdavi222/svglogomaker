# Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker

## Description
The SVG Logo Maker is a Node.js command-line application designed to help freelance web developers quickly generate simple logos for their projects without the need for a graphic designer. The application prompts users to input text, choose colors, and select shapes for their logos. It then generates an SVG image based on the user's choices and saves it as an .svg file.
